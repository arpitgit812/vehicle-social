# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model, remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns
# immediately below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

# Example fixture with columns defined:
three:
  column1: value1
  column2: value2

four:
  column1: value3
  column2: value4
